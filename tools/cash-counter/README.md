## üìã Example Calculation

Here is an example of a daily till count, demonstrating how the app calculates the float top-up, safe borrow, and final takings.

### Float Target Configuration
First, the float target is configured in the admin settings. This is the ideal amount of cash each till should have at the start of the day.

| Denomination | Float Needed (Count) | Float Target (Value) |
|--------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| $100         | 0                    | $0.00                |
| $50          | 1                    | $50.00               |
| $20          | 5                    | $100.00              |
| $10          | 10                   | $100.00              |
| $5           | 10                   | $50.00               |
| $2           | 10                   | $20.00               |
| $1           | 10                   | $10.00               |
| $0.50        | 10                   | $5.00                |
| $0.20        | 10                   | $2.00                |
| $0.10        | 10                   | $1.00                |
| $0.05        | 10                   | $0.50                |
| **Total**    |                      | **$338.50**          |

### Daily Till Count Example
A staff member counts the till at the end of the day and enters the following:

| Denomination | Count | Till Value | Borrow (from Safe) |
|--------------|-------|------------|--------------------|
| $100         | 2     | $200.00    | $0.00              |
| $50          | 10    | $500.00    | $0.00              |
| $20          | 4     | $80.00     | $20.00             |
| $10          | 15    | $150.00    | $0.00              |
| $5           | 8     | $40.00     | $10.00             |
| $2           | 20    | $40.00     | $0.00              |
| $1           | 15    | $15.00     | $0.00              |
| $0.50        | 5     | $2.50      | $2.50              |
| $0.20        | 12    | $2.40      | $0.00              |
| $0.10        | 8     | $0.80      | $0.20              |
| $0.05        | 3     | $0.15      | $0.35              |
| **Totals**   |       | **$1030.85** | **$33.05**         |

### Final Calculation
- **Till Total**: The total cash counted in the till.
  - `$1030.85`
- **Float Target**: The pre-configured ideal float.
  - `$338.50`
- **Safe Borrow**: The amount needed from the safe to bring the float up to the target for the next day.
  - `$33.05`
- **Takings**: The final amount to be banked.
  - Formula: `Takings = Till Total - Float Target + Safe Borrow`
  - Calculation: `$1030.85 - $338.50 + $33.05 =` **`$725.40`**

This provides a clear audit trail and simplifies the end-of-day cash handling process. The UI could also include images of the denominations, as shown in your example, to reduce errors.
