You are an expert developer proficient in TypeScript, React, and the Expo ecosystem.

## 1. Project Structure
- All application code will reside in the `/src` directory.
- Use the following folder structure:
  ```
  /src
  ├── assets/       # Images, fonts, etc.
  ├── components/   # Shared, reusable components
  ├── screens/      # Top-level screen components
  ├── navigation/   # React Navigation navigators and configuration
  ├── hooks/        # Custom React hooks
  ├── utils/        # Utility functions and helpers
  ├── services/     # API clients and external service logic
  └── styles/       # Global styles and theme definitions
  ```
- Each major directory (e.g., `components`, `screens`) should contain a `README.md` file explaining its purpose.

## 2. Coding Standards & Style
- **Components**: Use functional components with hooks. Component names must be `PascalCase`.
- **Variables**: Prioritize `const` over `let`. Variable and function names must be `camelCase`.
- **TypeScript**: Use TypeScript for all code to ensure type safety. Prefer `interfaces` over `types`.
- **Styling**: Use `StyleSheet.create()` for all component styling to optimize performance.
- **JSDoc**: Write comments for all functions and components in JSDoc format.

## 3. UI and State Management
- **UI Components**: Use `expo-vector-icons` for icons and standard React Native components for UI.
- **State Management**: Use React Context for simple state and consider Zustand for more complex, app-wide state.
- **Data Persistence**:
  - Use `AsyncStorage` for general local data.
  - Use `Expo SecureStore` for sensitive data like tokens or keys.
  - For the Cash Counter tool, use the `Google Sheets API` for cloud storage.

## 4. Navigation
- Use `React Navigation` as the standard for all routing and navigation.
- Implement lazy loading for screens to improve initial app performance.

## 5. Performance Optimization
- Wrap components that render complex data with `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- Optimize `useEffect` dependencies to ensure effects only run when needed.
- Optimize images using `expo-image` for caching and performance benefits.
- Implement proper offline support by caching data locally.

## 6. Error Handling & Testing
- **Error Handling**:
  - Wrap asynchronous operations in `try/catch` blocks.
  - Implement a global Error Boundary component to catch rendering errors.
- **Testing**:
  - Write unit tests using `Jest` and `React Native Testing Library`.
  - Use snapshot testing for UI components to track changes.
  - Aim for a minimum of 80% test coverage.

## 7. Expo SDK & Services
- **Expo Features**: Fully utilize Expo SDK features, including the asset system, push notifications, and Over-the-Air (OTA) updates.
- **Environment Variables**: Use `.env` files for managing environment variables.
- **APIs**: When interacting with external APIs like Shopify or Cin7, create dedicated service modules.

## 8. Documentation
- Each function and component should have JSDoc comments.
- Each main directory must contain a `README.md` file.
- **Note on Language**: The rules specify English and Chinese documentation. I will generate English documentation by default. Please specify if you require Chinese.

## 9. Output Expectations
- **Code Examples**: Provide code snippets that align with the guidelines above.
- **Explanations**: Include brief explanations to clarify complex implementations.
- **Clarity and Correctness**: Ensure all code is clear, correct, and ready for production.
- **Best Practices**: Demonstrate adherence to best practices in performance, security, and maintainability.
